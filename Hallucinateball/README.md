#Hallucinateball

Hallucinate + Basketball

If the ball is colorful and there are multiple baskets...the next thing more creative than simply "basketball" (which it technically isn't) is hallucinateball (shut up, I tried). One would hallucinate to see multiple baskets.

Maybe it should be "Beesketball" (bee + basketball) for the sight/perspective of a bee, who sees a different range of the color spectrum.

...Why am I typing this into the README? Is the pubic reading this? GO AWAY!
