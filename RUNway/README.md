#RUNway
Run away by jumping on trucks driving across the runway!

...Just kidding, change in plan.
Use the left, up, and right arrow keys to open the garage doors to allow the trucks to pass.
Points are deducted when the trucks are passing through and the door isn't open for it. Similarly, points are earned while the garage door is open to allow the trucks to pass though. Points are also deducted when the garage door is open when no trucks are passing through, so you can't just hold them all open forever! Earn the most points in the time frame!
